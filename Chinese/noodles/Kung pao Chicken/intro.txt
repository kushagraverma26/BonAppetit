Kung pao chicken, known by most fans as a Sichuan dish, has a much-debated origin within China. One popular theory is that Ding Baozhen, a Qing Dynasty governor in Sichuan province, tried it at a Sichuan restaurant and liked it so much that the dish was named after his official title, Gong Bao (which became “Kung Pao” in English). Others, however, dispute its origin in Sichuan, claiming the governor brought it from his childhood home in Guizhou province. Whichever the case, the important thing is that this highly addictive stir-fried chicken continues to be one of the most popular Chinese dishes in China as well as America.

The succulent, complex sauce of salty, sweet, sour, and spicy flavors is hard to pass up. One faux-pas restaurants in the U.S. sometimes make is adding tons of vegetatables like bell peppers and broccoli. The main protein, blistered chilis, and peanuts should be stars. Chunks of vegetables get in the way in terms of both flavor and appearance.



For years, Americanized versions of kung pao chicken also left out the Sichuan peppercorns because of an import ban, which is a shame since the numbing spiciness ("mala" in Chinese) is integral to the dish. Now, fortunately, Sichuan peppercorn is once again easily found in Chinatown shops and even gourmet chains like Whole Foods.

So pick up some chicken on your way home from work and try this out. This tastes better than any takeout kung pao chicken you may have tried.
