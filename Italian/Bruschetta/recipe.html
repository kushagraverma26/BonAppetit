		Bruschetta (Italian pronunciation: [bruˈsketta] ) is an antipasto (starter dish) from Italy consisting of grilled bread rubbed with garlic and topped with olive oil and salt. Variations may include toppings of tomato, vegetables, beans, cured meat, or cheese. A popular dish is Bruschetta with tomatoes; the most popular recipe outside Italy[citation needed] involves basil, fresh tomato, garlic and onion or mozzarella. Bruschetta is usually served as a snack or appetizer. In some countries, a topping of chopped tomato, olive oil and herbs is marketed under the bruschetta name.
In Italy, bruschetta is often prepared using a brustolina grill. In the Abruzzo region of Italy a variation of bruschetta made with a salame called ventricina is served. Raw pork products and spices encased in pig bladder are aged and the paste spread on open slices of bread which are sometimes grilled. This was a way of salvaging bread that was going stale. In Tuscany it is called fettunta and it is usually served without toppings, especially in November, to taste the very first oil of the season.

<div class="sub" style="font-size: 32px;font-weight: bold;;" data-aos="fade-in">
	
	<h1 data-aos="slide-right">Recipe</h1>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3><br>
6 or 7 ripe plum tomatoes (about 1 1/2 lbs)<br>
2 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)<br>
1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br>
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar<br>
6-8 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced* or chopped<br>
1 teaspoon kosher salt, more or less to taste<br>
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more or less to taste<br>
1 baguette French bread or similar Italian bread<br>
1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil<br><br>






	<h3>Directions</h3><br>

1. Blanch and peel the tomatoes: Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes (this will make the tomatoes easier to peel).
Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute.
 
Remove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then gently peel off the tomato skins. Cut out the stem base with a paring knife.
Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.<br>
 
2 .Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.<br>
3 .Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper: Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar.
Stir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste. Note, tomatoes love salt; you may need to add more than you expect.<br>

4 .Toast the baguette slices: Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan.
The baguette slices will toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all.
When the oven has reached 450°F (230°C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.<br>
 
If you want you can toast the bread slices without coating them first in olive oil. Toast them until lightly browned on both sides. Then cut a clove of garlic in half and rub over one side of the toast. Then brush with olive oil. (See Easiest Ever Garlic Bread.)<br>
5 .Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture: Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).<br>
