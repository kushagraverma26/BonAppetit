Embraced in the kitchens of Goa during Portuguese colonisation, vinegar is a key ingredient in Goan cuisine, giving many of its dishes their signature sharp edge. Balch√£o consists of a fiery, pickle-like tomato and chilli sauce, and while we've used prawns here, fish or pork can also be cooked in this way. Coconut toddy vinegar, made from coconut flower sap, is traditionally used in Goa, but we've used coconut vinegar (made from fermented coconut water), which also lends tang and a hint of coconut.
