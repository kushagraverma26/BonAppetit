Add chillies, ginger and garlic and stir for 3 minutes or until ginger has softened. Add turmeric, cloves and vinegar, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until slightly reduced. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Place in a food processor or blender and process until smooth. Set aside.

Heat 60 ml of the oil in a clean frying pan over medium heat. Add onions and cook, stirring, for 8 minutes or until softened and slightly coloured. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring, for 4 minutes, or until starting to break down. Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.

Add chilli and garlic mixture, cinnamon quill and half the curry leaves, and simmer for 5 minutes or until slightly reduced. Add prawns and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, or until just cooked through. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside and keep warm.

Heat remaining 25 ml oil in a clean frying pan over medium heat. Fry remaining curry leaves for 10 seconds or until crisp. Divide prawn balchão between serving bowls, scatter with fried curry leaves and serve with naan.
